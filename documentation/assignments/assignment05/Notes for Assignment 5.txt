Notes for Assignment 5 - Modify the GrowList class to implement the Iterable interface.

This assignment was completed by William Austin and Anzal Khan. We collaborated on the code by sharing a
Github repository and discussing various aspects of the problem. Both of us contributed to the code, and
associated JUnit tests. Some notes about the assignment are below. 

* Our code is placed in the package that makes sense for our repository. You may need to copy it elsewhere to test it. 
  There are no external dependencies.

* We have used the provided implementation for GrowList, but taken liberty to format it conveniently. As before, we allow 
  the GrowList to contain null elements. There are associated JUnit tests for this scenario.

* The JUnit tests have been created to test the GrowList class, and are based off of our tests from Assignments #3 and #4. They 
  cover the public API for GrowList, but they are not completely exhaustive. All of the tests for 
  
* After visiting the contract for the GrowList class, we have concluede that the remove() method of the iterator must
  throw an UnsupportedOperationException. If this operation were allowed, the list would decrease in size, which is not allowed. 
  Therefore, our javadoc and JUnits show this behavior.

* As a side effort, we have implemented another version of the class, called GrowListWithRemove that fully implements the remove()
  operation. This allowed us to further investigate some of the challenges to producing a correct implementation for the full set
  of methods included in the Iterator interface. JUnits are provided.
  
* Our submission includes java source files, a test (JUnit) file for each source file, JUnit output, and javadocs.
